Excited to be working with them to ensure a good launch.\n\nThis time, we saw a record turn-out of 230M staked JUP participating, across 334K voters! We hope that every team that participated in the vote had a good time, and also gained traction and publicity from doing so.\n\nDuring the vote, we also conducted a Twitter Spaces where the community shared feedback on the LFG process so far. We’ll be incorporating some of this feedback into LFG going forward, to improve the launchpad alongside the community. Expect an update on this soon.\n\nExpect to see more introductions and improvements rolling out to Discord & LFG over the next few weeks. \n\nWith this, we’ve concluded the second vote for LFG, and brainstormed improvements needed for the platform.\n\nThe CWG will be resuming introductions for the next round of LFG as well next week. If you’re interested in being part of LFG, apply on the forum!\n\nhttps://jupresear.ch/c/lfg-intros/12\n\nOnce again, a thank you to our voters, project teams, and everyone for being part of this journey!"

We want set clear expectations of how Season 4 will work, and how it will not:\n\nPoints will be linear \uD83D\uDC4D. This means no curve will be applied, and there is no advantage to using multiple wallets. Screenshot this, frame it, hold the points system accountable to this.\nFoundation still reserves the right to turn off points for collections ⭐\uFE0F. This is to combat high wash trading activity we're seeing on certain collections.\nThere will not be a unified leaderboard \uD83E\uDD47. The split of points between different Tensor products (eg Marketplace vs Price Lock) will not be disclosed. Points will be allocated proportional to economic activity in each of these protocols. This means if price lock has low activity relative to the marketplace, it will earn fewer points.\n\nThe mechanics for Season 4 will work similar to Season 3, meaning the more you bid, list, or market-make closer to the floor, the more points you will earn. Tracking for S4 will be released once we have made a few adjustments to the system based on data we've collected in S3.\n\nAs a reminder, the points system is to ultimately reward users who contribute to most to growing Tensor protocols. This means:\n\n✅ Providing liquidity earns points\n✅ Tensorians earn a points multiplier\n✅ Referrals earn both points and fees (must be a Tensorian)\n\nHappy trading and here's to a fruitful Season 4!"

        "content": "A few smol things for Monday:\n\nThe announcement from the Foundation is expected 10am ET\nPer Foundation, the announcement will contain tokenomics, governance docs, and a claim checker. You'll know your allocation at that point.\nOne hour later (11am ET) you'll be able to claim your tokens and trading will begin.\nThere has been some confusion around Treasure Boxes, so wanted to clarify. You ARE getting boxes for S3, but you will not be seeing them (or the S1/S2 boxes) on the claim site. To maximize the safety of the claim process the Foundation has gone with Jupiter's battle-tested infrastructure, and their claim site doesn't show boxes. So you'll just see your final allocation instead. Don't worry, loyalty has been factored in, and those of you who remained loyal got significantly more rare TBs.\nFinally, on congestion. Solana right now is experiencing congestion. This is obviously not something we can predict/control, but we'll setup the infrastructure to be as robust as possible and the claim will be open for 6 months, so you'll have plenty of time to complete it.\n\nExcited for the next chapter for the Tensor ecosystem."
