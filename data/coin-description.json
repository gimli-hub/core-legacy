  "bitcoin": "Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency. It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=SHA-256\">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/primecoin\">Primecoin</a>, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> which led to the development of other amazing projects such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a>, and even crypto-collectibles such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ethereum-still-king-dapps-cryptokitties-need-1-billion-on-eos\">CryptoKitties</a>.",
  "ethereum": "Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.",
  "tether": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called \u201cstable coins.\u201d Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or \u201ctether\u201d the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] \u201c100% backed by USD\u201d (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can\u2019t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.",
  "binancecoin": "Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> platform. It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name \"Binance\" is a combination of binary and finance.\r\n\r\nThus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?asset_platform_id=279\">ERC20 token standard</a> from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.\r\n\r\nOther tokens that are issued by exchanges include <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox Token</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb\">OKB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/huobi-token\">Huobi Token</a>, and more.",

  "ripple": "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs\">Ripple Labs</a>, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin\u2019s</a> development. It also doesn\u2019t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself \u2014 around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple\u2019s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, and isn\u2019t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven\u2019t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading. ",

  "bitcoin-cash": "Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\">Bitcoin Core software</a>. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core\u2019s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>",
  "litecoin": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\">Scrypt proof of work</a> mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or \u2018altcoin\u2019 has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\">Coinbase</a>, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u2018While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,\u2019 Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin\u2019s blocks would be larger, but with more \u2018orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a>) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins.

The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can\u2019t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum\u2019s concept of \u201cgas\u201d. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be \u201cbonded\u201d in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more \u201cskin\u201d there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.\r\n\r\nAtom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.",

  "stellar": "The Stellar network is an open source, distributed, and community owned network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">XRP</a> and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people\u2019s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn\u2019t working as intended \u2014 account holders either didn\u2019t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise \u2014 and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

  "maker": "MKR is a cryptocurrency depicted as a smart contract platform and works alongside the Dai coin and aims to act as a hedge currency that provides traders with a stable alternative to the majority of coins currently available on the market. Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.",

  "elrond-erd-2": "What is MultiversX \r\n\r\nMultiversX is a blockchain protocol that offers true horizontal scalability by using all aspects of sharding (Network, Transaction & State). The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes decentralized finance, real world assets and the Metaverse. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second, 6-second latency and a $0.002 transaction cost. MultiversX is governed and secured through the EGLD token. EGLD, or Electronic Gold, is MultiversX's native token. It acts as a store of value currency to pay for network usage. The coin also serves as a medium of exchange between platform users and validators. Users pay transaction fees in EGLD and validators participate in the consensus process. EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. It empowers participants to perform any network action. Through staking and validation rewards, as well as transaction fees, EGLD manages the MultiversX network. Plus, EGLD is endowed with the functionality of a governance token, so its holders can vote on network decisions. \r\n\r\nHow does MultiversX Work \r\n\r\nAccording to the MultiversX crypto team, the project implements three types of parallelization: state, transactions, and network, using the parallel processing method to speed up the time and increase the number of transactions. MultiversX uses Adaptive State Sharding to scale while sharing infrastructure to support a growing number of applications/transactions on the ledger. A variation of the traditional PoS operational protocol guarantees the connection to the platform of all sections of the network, separated during sharding. Hence, the integrated environment is involved in the development of dApps, which are imitations of products and services. MultiversX combines three sharding methods to create its own unique adaptive one. It divides the network into four shards: three being execution shards that process transactions, validating 30,000 transactions per second, and Metachain is the fourth shard that coordinates and completes transactions. Sharding types include: State sharding where the history of the network, or state, is distributed across different sections of the network, or shards. Segments have their own ledger, nodes store the state of each segment; Transaction sharding where transactions are mapped to segments and processed, segments process transactions in parallel and nodes capture the state of the entire network; Network sharding where the nodes are grouped into segments and then processed. Network slicing contributes to optimizing communications. \r\n\r\nWhat makes MultiversX Unique \r\n\r\nMultiversX describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, decentralized applications and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset. To achieve this goal, the network runs on 3,200 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second in total, and one coordination shard, the \"Metachain.\" MultiversX's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding additional shards when the throughput demand requires. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards. To increase adoption, the blockchain also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.\r\n",

  "mad lads": "Mad Lads is a Solana network NFT project developed by the Backpack team. Mad Lads is a collection of 9966 NFT which was minted on Apr 20, 2023 at the price of 6.9 SOL. Mad Lads project had strong initial hype due to the team leaders’ reputation. Tristan Yver was Head of Strategy at FTXUS and the host of the FTX Podcast. He was with FTX for two years, and helped scale many different verticals within the business. Tristan was a key figure in the early growth of the Solana ecosystem, incubating many of the projects you see on mainnet today. Currently he leads the business development side of the Backpack project. Armani Ferrante is the tech lead of the project. Ferrante created Coral, a platform for Web3 developers. Coral made an immediate impact by developing Anchor in 2021. Anchor is now Solana’s most popular smart contract developer framework.In 2022, FTX and Jump Capital led a $20m investment round in Anchor. This investment gave Coral the funding to develop xNFT Backpack, an interactive crypto wallet.\n\nFerrante and Coral developed the Mad Lads NFT project as the first release for the xNFT Backpack platform. There was a ton of hype for the project right away and bots attacked the mint. The mint was delayed at first and the Mad Labs team regrouped.\n\nThe team showed off its coding chops by then programming its mint to honeypot bots. Any SOL sent by bots was taken by the team to redistribute to the project’s treasury, and after the dust settled, real people were able to mint. The move caught the attention of the NFT space and Mad Lads became a blue chip project quickly after.\n\nSince then, holders have enjoyed the project’s vibes and commended its unique artwork. Mad Lads seems to be a project with real staying power, and with Mad Armani at the helm, have the leadership to become one of Web3’s biggest ecosystems.\n\nMad Lads holders benefited from receiving a number of airdrops such as Wormhole token. The team has created their own centralized exchange  - Backpack.exchange.\n\nMad Skulls is a DAO of one of the Mad Lads NFT categories - NFTs with skull visuals. Skull NFTs have been trading significantly high prices than other Mad Lads NFTs.\n",
  "bonk": "Like PEPE and DOGE, BONK is a meme coin inspired by internet memes, jokes, and satire. Meme coins are not designed with a specific use case in mind, but rather as a way to express humor, creativity, and social commentary through cryptocurrency.\n\nLike PEPE and DOGE, BONK is a meme coin inspired by internet memes, jokes, and satire. Meme coins are not designed with a specific use case in mind, but rather as a way to express humor, creativity, and social commentary through cryptocurrency.\nWhile BONK is similar to DOGE and SHIB in that it features a cute dog as its mascot and logo, it differs from them in several ways.\n1.  BONK is built on Solana. Referred to as the ‘Ethereum killer’ when it launched, Solana is a fast, scalable, and low-cost blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications with over 400 dApps currently running on its network (Solana is also home to 2024’s other stellar performer Dogwifhat).\n2. BONK was launched with a massive airdrop on December 25, 2022, as a Christmas gift to the Solana community. 50% of the total supply of 100 trillion coins was distributed to Solana users who contributed to the development and growth of the network in some way. This included artists, creators, developers, NFT collectors, and active community members. The airdrop was done randomly and anonymously, without any pre-announcement or marketing.\n3. BONK’s integration with the Solana ecosystem. BONK’s whitepaper outlines its ambition to become the “community coin of Solana,” used across numerous decentralized applications. The project aims to challenge the dominance of “predatory VC tokens” by empowering the wider Solana community. This is evident in its approach to airdropping 50% of its total supply.\nThe 1-year correlation between SOL and BONK currently sits at 0.76. The coin is accepted as a payment option for NFTs on several platforms, such as OpenBook and Orca. It is also used as an incentive for staking NFTs on platforms like SolFarm and BonkStake. Moreover, BONK is listed on several popular crypto exchanges that support Solana-based tokens, such as Coinbase, Binance and Serum.\nTokenomics of BONK\nMarket Position: As of March 22nd 2024, BONK is the sixth-largest meme coin by market cap, following DOGE, Shiba Inu, PEPE, WIF and FLOKI and the 70th largest crypto overall.\nImpressive Growth: BONK has seen an extraordinary increase of over 3000% year-on-year.\nSupply Details: The coin has a maximum supply of 100 trillion, with 65 trillion in circulation as of mid-March 2024.\nBONK has several features that make it stand out from other meme coins. One of them is its community-driven nature. The team behind BONK does not have any control over the coin’s supply or direction. Instead, they have delegated 15% of the total supply to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Bonk DAO. The Bonk DAO is responsible for making decisions regarding the future development and governance of BONK. Anyone who holds BONK tokens can participate in the Bonk DAO by voting on proposals or submitting their own ideas.\nOther meme coins that have a longer history and similar large market caps, like PEPE, have been ignored by Coinbase, but with BONK the ‘Coinbase Effect’ is clearly evident. The listing has boosted the mainstream legitimacy of the BONK token and introduced it to Coinbase’s large user base. In addition, BONK perpetual swap derivatives can be traded on the popular trading platform, Bitmex, with up to 10x leverage. In addition to Coinbase, today BONK trading pairs are available on most major platforms including Binance, OKX, Gate.io, ByBit, HTX and KuCoin.",
  "pyth": "Pyth is an oracle network that services various blockchains, protocols, and projects within the Web3 and broader cryptocurrency industry. Oracles provide a way for blockchains and protocols to access data that exists offchain. For example, Solana can compute each account’s balance of SOL tokens, but it cannot compute the price of a SOL token, as that data depends on offchain inputs such as pricing data from centralized exchanges (CEXs).\nPyth’s flagship product is Price Feeds, which provides near real-time pricing data for a variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, commodities, and stocks. Price feeds enable third-party applications, such as lending protocols, to incorporate pricing data that helps facilitate proper operations. In the case of a lending protocol, faulty or incorrect pricing data can lead to bad debt accruing and losses for the protocol’s liquidity providers (LPs).\nOracle services like Chainlink (LINK) have played a key role in spearheading this merger between the old and the new, allowing blockchains to pull in information, such as price feeds, from crypto exchanges and other real-world data sources.\nOriginally designed for the speed-centric Solana (SOL) blockchain and later built out into its own chain, Pythnet, based on Solana's technology, the project claims on its website that it refreshes its data feeds at 300-400 millisecond intervals. Chainlink's refresh rate, by contrast, can range from minutes to hours.\n\n\nChainlink's comparatively slow pace comes down to how it sources data, by relying on \"decentralized\" consortiums of third-party data providers and a network of node operators to report out information. Chainlink's price feeds refresh at set intervals, or dynamically in response to market volatility, but recent latency-focused updates have brought significant speed improvements for some applications.\n\n\nPyth, by contrast, sources data directly from first-party financial institutions – both traditional and crypto-centric – like Jane Street and Binance. This institution-driven system carries whiffs of \"centralization\" – anathema to the disintermediating world of crypto. But Pyth's sub-second refresh model is several orders of magnitude faster than some competing services, supposedly better-tuned to serving the demands of modern finance.\n\n\nLike Chainlink and other competing services, the Pythnet network can aggregate its price measurements from multiple sources. Pyth, on its website, claims to rely on various game theory and cryptography practices to ensure its numbers are reported accurately; for example, the \"bridge\" service that Pyth uses to relay data to blockchains, Wormhole, automatically runs certain checks before reporting numbers to blockchains.\n\n\nWhile these validation services can help protect Pyth's numbers from tampering, the system – like those of other oracle protocols – can still risk measurement errors if multiple sources report inaccurate numbers.\nPyth kicked off the highly-anticipated airdrop of its PYTH token. The new cryptocurrency will double as votes in the protocol's governance system, meaning the tokens can be \"staked\" by users who want to weigh in on how Pyth's tech evolves or who can publish data to its oracles.\n.\nIn addition to jump-starting the market for a new token, protocols frequently use airdrops as a tactic to gain attention and attract users.\n",
  "jito": "As a liquid staking protocol operating on a stake pool model, Jito first caught attention when it announced a massive crypto airdrop for its native JTO tokens. Those tokens went to JitoSOL holders, Solana validators who used Jito Solana’s MEV clients, and users of Jito’s MEV services. This action seemed to breathe new life into Solana's ecosystem as total value locked (TVL) levels exponentially increased as more users got introduced to Jito.\n\nstaking has become popular for the passive gains it offers. This process typically involves contributing crypto assets to validators who secure the network's consensus mechanism. In exchange, stakers earn a portion of the network's rewards for simply locking up the underlying coins and tokens. While this might have the potential for crypto traders to reap extra rewards while gaining exposure to their favorite cryptocurrencies, it comes with the drawback of illiquidity. This is because staked assets are typically locked for a predetermined period, hindering their immediate usability and limiting users' access to their capital.\nEnter liquid staking — an innovation that has entirely disrupted the traditional staking model. Instead of locking up users' crypto assets, Jito pools them together and delegates them to validators on their behalf. However, the key differentiator lies in the issuance of JitoSOL, a synthetic token representing users' staked assets. JitoSOL remains freely tradable and accessible in the wallets of Jito users and grants them the liquidity they desire without compromising on staking rewards.\n\nJito is one of Solana’s largest liquid staking protocols and operates on a stake pool model. It offers users JitoSOL in exchange for Solana deposited on Jito that's committed to on-chain staking. Jito is one of the early pioneers in bringing Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) enhanced liquid staking to Solana, allowing users to earn both staking rewards and MEV yield on their staked SOL tokens. The end goal for Jito is to create a mutually beneficial system where everyone can gain from Solana ecosystem inefficiencies.\n\nJito's origins trace back to 2021 and is the brainchild of former Tesla engineer Lucas Bruder. Inspired by the untapped potential of MEV, Bruder envisioned a streamlined platform that's made accessible to everyday crypto users on Solana. Joined by Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko and backed by Solana Ventures and other investors, Bruder's vision materialized with $10 million in funding. This success paved the way for the Jito Foundation, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) overseeing Jito Labs and its mission to democratize MEV.\n\nCompared to other liquid staking protocols on Solana, Jito's secret weapon is its Block Engine, a hyper-optimized transaction reordering engine that extracts MEV from the Solana network. It operates akin to a high-frequency trading system that accesses on-chain data and strategically reorders transactions within blocks to capture fleeting arbitrage opportunities and frontrunning potential. This generates additional yield for stakers on top of regular staking rewards, effectively squeezing more juice out of every Solana transaction. By employing advanced transaction simulation and deep learning algorithms, the engine continuously evolves, staying ahead of the curve and maximizing MEV capture for the Jito community.\n\nHere's a simple step-by-step process that'll explain the entire liquid staking process and allow you to enjoy MEV-empowered liquid staking gains:\nDeposit your Solana: You start by depositing your Solana coins into Jito's platform. This gives Jito permission to use your crypto for staking and MEV capture.\nJito pools and delegates your SOL: Jito combines your Solana with other users' tokens into a large pool. This pool is then delegated to validators, who are responsible for securing the Solana network.\nEarn staking rewards: As a reward for contributing to network security, you earn regular staking rewards. These rewards come from the network itself and are distributed based on the amount of Solana you've staked.\nMEV capture for extra yield: Jito actively seeks out opportunities to capture MEV. MEV is essentially extra gains that can be extracted from certain blockchain transactions. Jito uses a proprietary system known as the Jito Block Engine to analyze transaction data and strategically order transactions to maximize MEV capture. This additional yield is then shared with you, boosting your overall earnings.\nReceive JitoSOL: In exchange for your deposited Solana, Jito gives you JitoSOL tokens. These tokens represent your staked Solana and allow you to enjoy benefits like bonus liquidity and the benefit of dual rewards.\nUltimately, Jito's MEV-powered liquid staking allows you to earn staking rewards, capture additional MEV yield, and maintain liquidity and flexibility with your staked Solana — all while contributing to the security of the Solana network.\n\n\nJitoSOL empowers users in several ways, namely:\nEarning double rewards: users earn both staking rewards generated through the delegated SOL and MEV rewards captured by Jito's proprietary optimization techniques. This occurs even when you're using them in other DeFi protocols and grants multiple streams of yield from your staked Solana.\nUnleashing DeFi liquidity: JitoSOL tokens are freely tradable and usable in other DeFi applications. This means you're not locked into staking for a fixed period and can access the value of your staked assets whenever you need them. Examples of use across various DeFi protocols include participation in liquidity pools, lending platforms, and other yield-generating strategies on DApps like Orca and Kamino Finance.\nJTO is a governance token that allows community members to participate in the Jito DAO and vote on all future critical decisions shaping Jito's future. This can range from protocol upgrades to fee structures.\n\n\nGeneral governance utility aside, here are some other forms of JTO utility:\nMEV shareholding: JTO holders get a slice of the MEV pie and get to enjoy additional gains captured by the Jito Block Engine.\nCommunity access: JTO is your passport to exclusive Jito community events, airdrops, and early access to exciting new features.\nPotential future staking pools: While it hasn't been officially announced, holding JTO could unlock access to special JTO-only staking pools with potentially higher rewards.\nPotential future staking multiplier: The team is considering incorporating future JTO utility in that holding JTO tokens will boost your JitoSOL staking rewards. However, this is still under development and details haven't been finalized.\nWith a total supply of 1 billion, JTO will be distributed as follows:\nCommunity growth: 24.3% — to be managed by DAO governance on the Realms platform.\nEcosystem development: 25% — to be used for funding communities and contributors aiding the project’s growth.\nCore contributors: 24.5% — to be allocated to the Jito team, which includes Jito Foundation employees, partners, and other internal project contributors.\nInvestors: 16.2% — to be distributed over three years with a one-year cliff.\nAirdrop: 10% — 90% of which will be immediately accessible on distribution day, while the remaining 10% unlocks over a year.\n",
